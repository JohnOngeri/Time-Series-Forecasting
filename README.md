## Dataset

The dataset contains hourly air quality measurements from Beijing, including:
- **PM2.5**: Target variable (particulate matter ≤ 2.5 micrometers)
- **Weather features**: Temperature (TEMP), Dew Point (DEWP), Pressure (PRES)
- **Wind data**: Wind speed (Iws), Wind direction components (cbwd_*)
- **Solar radiation**: Is, Ir components
- **Datetime**: Hourly timestamps

## Model Architectures

The project implements and compares multiple architectures:

1. **Baseline RNN**: Simple recurrent neural network
2. **Simple LSTM**: Single LSTM layer
3. **Stacked LSTM**: Multiple LSTM layers with batch normalization
4. **Bidirectional LSTM**: Processes sequences in both directions
5. **GRU**: Gated Recurrent Unit variant

## Features

### Data Preprocessing
- Missing value imputation (mean, median, interpolation)
- Time-based feature engineering (cyclical encoding)
- Lag features (1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 hours)
- Rolling statistics (mean, std, min, max, percentiles)
- Weather interaction features
- Seasonal indicators

### Model Training
- Time-series cross-validation
- Early stopping and learning rate scheduling
- Gradient clipping for stability
- Multiple optimizers (Adam, RMSprop, SGD)
- Comprehensive hyperparameter search

### Evaluation
- RMSE metric (target: < 3000)
- Residual analysis
- Actual vs predicted comparisons
- Loss curve visualization
- Statistical significance testing
